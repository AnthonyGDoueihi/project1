# Game Glossary Creator

## Project 1

[The Link to the Project](https://pacific-garden-72873.herokuapp.com/)

A Ruby on Rails project.

A place to create your own custom lore pages for any story you create, whether that is a ttrpg or a book, this is a place to store your info to share with others.

Unfinished at the moment. Have some core functionality to still create and other features like Glossary page customisation and a search menu to create.

AND THANK YOUS TO JOEL AND YIANNI
